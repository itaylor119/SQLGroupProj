Work is split by odds/evens. Jared will do odds, I will do evens.

	Query 1:
SELECT title_id
FROM titles
WHERE title = (SELECT title FROM titles WHERE title = 'The Busy Executive''s Database Guide');

Result:
+----------+
| title_id |
+----------+
| BU1032   |
+----------+

	Query 2: SELECT SUM(qty) FROM sales WHERE title_id = "PS2091";

Result: Column "SUM(qty)", value 108.

	Query 3:
*
I didn't use the FORMAT function to format the function as it gave me warnings. Instead, I opted to use the CAST function.
If the FORMAT function is required, simply replace "CAST(AVG( SA.qty ) AS int)" With "FORMAT(AVG( SA.qty ), '##')".
It yields the same table, but it has warnings.
*

SELECT ST.stor_name AS Store, SUM( SA.qty ) AS Sum, CAST(AVG( SA.qty ) AS int) AS Avg
FROM stores ST
JOIN sales SA
ON ST.stor_id = SA.stor_id
GROUP BY ST.stor_name;

Result:
+--------------------------------------+------+------+
| Store                                | Sum  | Avg  |

	Query 4: SELECT stor_name AS Store, DATE_FORMAT(S.ord_date, "%m/%d/%Y") AS Date, S.qty FROM stores ST
JOIN sales S ON ST.stor_id = S.stor_id
WHERE S.title_id = "PS2091";

Result: Exactly as shown in lab instructions.

	Query 5:CREATE FUNCTION F_AS_DATE_2(d CHAR(8)) 
RETURNS VARCHAR(20) DETERMINISTIC
RETURN DATE_FORMAT(d, "%m/%d/%Y");

SELECT P.pub_name AS Publisher, CONCAT(E.fname, ' ', E.lname) AS Employee, F_AS_DATE_2(E.hire_date) AS 'Date of Hire', E.job_lvl
FROM employee E
JOIN publishers P
ON E.pub_id = P.pub_id
WHERE job_id = (SELECT job_id FROM jobs WHERE job_desc = 'Designer');

	Query 6: SELECT stor_name AS Store, T.title AS Title, (S.qty * T.price) AS Total FROM stores ST
JOIN sales S ON ST.stor_id = S.stor_id
JOIN titles T ON T.title_id = S.title_id;

Result: Exactly as shown in lab instructions.
